# Custom Data Notebook

Inside this folder, you'll find the Jupyter notebook `custom-data-notebook.ipynb`. This notebook is designed to be your starting point for your data science journey, leveraging the knowledge you've gained from our previous workshop sessions. Here, you'll have the opportunity to apply your skills in prompt engineering and data science using a dataset of your choice.

## Notebook Structure

The notebook is structured into three main sections: set-up, data analysis, and data modeling. It follows the same format as the `fm-ad-notebook.ipynb`, with the additional inclusion of the data modeling section. This new section is dedicated to building machine learning models tailored for datasets that exhibit predictability potential.

## Recommended datasets

### [RODA](https://registry.opendata.aws/)

The Registry of Open Data on AWS (RODA) makes it easy for people to find datasets that are publicly available through AWS. Below are recommended datasets from RODA:

- [A Realistic Cyber Defense Dataset](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-qkyroawpr2aw6?sr=0-153&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa#resources)
- [COVID-19 Harmonized Data](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-hlb5psmw7gu3a?sr=0-315&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa#overview)

### [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets)

The UCI Machine Learning Repository is a collection of databases, domain theories, and data generators that are used by the machine learning community for the empirical analysis of machine learning algorithms. Below are recommended datasets from UCI ML Repo:

- [Iris](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris)
- [Bank Marketing](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing)

### [scikit](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets.html)

Scikit-learn is a popular machine learning library in Python. It provides various datasets for practice and experimentation, often used in tutorials and examples to demonstrate machine learning algorithms and techniques. Below are recommended datasets from scikit:

- [California Housing](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/real_world.html#california-housing-dataset)
- [MNIST](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_digits_classification.html)
